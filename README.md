🏥 EVEYES 360: Digital Healing & Biosonology Platform

"If cells had a voice, how would you heal them?"
EVEYES 360 is a pioneering Biosonology Analysis and Therapy Management Platform that bridges the gap between modern microbiological data and the thousand-year-old medical heritage of the Seljuk Era. It transforms laboratory data from mere numbers into tangible acoustic evidence and healing resonance.
✨ Key Features
 * 🧬 Intelligent Biosonology Engine: Analyzes real-time decibel (dB) data from cellular vibrations and calculates biological resonance.
 * 🎵 Seljuk Maqam Algorithm: Integrates ancient wisdom from Gevher Nesibe Healing House with modern medicine. It automatically assigns the most suitable musical scale (Hicaz, Neva, Rast) for "Acoustic Tuning" based on cellular frequency.
 * 📊 Live Graphics Dashboard: Visualizes data with responsive, professional charts. It features an automated alert system that flags critical values (above 100 dB) in red.
 * 🔊 Real-Time Sound Synthesis: Generates a physical .wav audio file representing the cell's current state. This allows practitioners to not only see the data but also hear it.
 * 🔒 Maximum Security (Local-First): Operates entirely on-premises. Data is stored in a local SQL vault, ensuring full privacy and compliance with data protection standards.
 * 📦 Docker Ready: Fully containerized for "Plug & Play" deployment across different environments.
 * 🌍 Multilingual Support: Designed for global healthcare standards with an adaptable multi-language interface.
🛠️ Tech Stack
 * Backend: Python (Flask)
 * Database: SQLite3
 * Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Chart.js)
 * Audio Processing: NumPy, SciPy
 * Deployment: Docker & Docker Compose
🚀 Quick Start (Docker)
To run the project locally using Docker, simply navigate to the project folder and run:
docker-compose up
Then open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000
📜 Scientific Background
This project is built upon the synthesis of Biosonology and Ancient Music Psychotherapy. It treats cellular health as an "acoustic balance." By mapping cellular decibel levels to traditional Seljuk maqams, EVEYES 360 explores the synergy between mechanical vibration and biological recovery.
🤝 Contributing
This is a modular project. Future updates will include:
 * AI Module: Image processing for cellular anomaly detection.
 * Mobile Portal: Real-time monitoring for healthcare professionals.
